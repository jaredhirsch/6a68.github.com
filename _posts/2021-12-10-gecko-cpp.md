Probably not useful for anybody, but something I told myself I'd do: share out some C++ notes.

These notes are based on the 2016? Mozilla C++ and Gecko onboarding presentation by froydnj: https://mozilla.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Embed.aspx?id=65922cea-26e0-4d3b-a5da-ac1600012f45

I don't know why this talk is set to Mozilla-private, I'm working on getting it made public.

Anyway here we go.

-----

Basic topics to cover:

- Subsystems in Gecko
- XPCOM strings and datatypes
- infallible alloc
- coding style
- C++ guidelines

Additional topics suggested by Gecko experts:

- Refcounting
- Smart pointers
- IDLs: XPIDL, WebIDL, IPDL
- Electrolysis (e10s) (TODO: this video predates fission and should be brought up to date)
- NSPR
- Threading
- C++ visibility

Outline of the talk:

1. What happens when I click a link? (Intro to subsystems and overall network and rendering pipeline)
2. Nuts and bolts of Gecko C++
3. Code generation
4. Memory management
  - Smart pointers
  - Reference counting schemes
5. Gecko C++ data structures

## What happens when I click a link?

Sequence: Network -> Parser -> DOM -> Styles -> Layout -> Display List -> Paint -> Composite

Docshell is where it all begins: Docshell sets up, then network loads
- `/docshell` directory (see also `/uriloader`)
- URI loading starts
- Handles navigating between docs (back-forward movement)
- Starts doc loading
- Sets things up for network
- Manages session history
- See also uriloader (we probably should merge these eventually)

Networking code
- `/netwerk` dir (the misspelling is deliberate and historical)
- `/netwerk/dns` has DNS-related code
  - We use the OS for DNS resolution
  - We add in other stuff
  - DNS is done off the main thread and parallelized
- `/netwerk/protocol` has code for protocols (HTTP, FTP, WebSocket, ...)
- `/netwerk/cache2` handles document caching
  - We cache documents on disk for speed
  - There's old code in `/netwerk/cache`, unclear why it's not deleted. Ignore it.
- `/netwerk/cookie` manages cookies

Once the network returns data, DocShell sets up listeners to handle the results.

Next: the parser, which handles the network response.

### Parsing

- `/parser` directory
- Multiple parsers:
  - XML (`/parser/xm`, `/parser/expat`)
  - old-style HTML `/parser/htmlparser`, only used for `about:blank` as of 2016
  - HTML5 (`/parser/html`)
  - Old-style parsers had a lot of quirks at handling parsing errors
  - HTML5 is much better specified for error handling
  - Expat is ~20 years old, we use it for XML parsing
    - It's very simple and very fast

As the parser parses, it builds DOM nodes for all elements
Loading other formats (CSS, JS, images) is driven by the parser, but handled elsewhere.

### DOM

- `dom` directory
- Absolutely massive directory
  - Documents, elements all live in `dom/base`, `/dom/html`
  - Various web APIs often have individual subdirectories, like `/dom/indexedDB`
  - WebAPI definitions are imported into `/dom/webidl` for spec conformance verification
    - These definitions are also used to code generate JS bindings in `/dom/bindings`

DOM builds up the linked tree of DOM nodes
Next, we need to position nodes on a 2D page.

### Layout

- Translates the DOM tree to 2D canvas.
- Every visible DOM node gets its own Frame, then Layout figures out how to position the Frames relative to each other
- `/layout` directory
- also massive
  - Our CSS implementation is in `/layout/style`
  - `/base`, `/generic`: Frames (box around each element), Display Lists (organizing Frames so we can paint them quickly)
  - `/layout/svg` holds the SVG code
  - `/layout/xul` XUL

Given a bunch of boxes, now we need to paint them to the screen.

### Graphics

- `/gfx` directory
- also large, but mainly because we use third-party libraries
- We have our own code for some 2D primitives in `/gfx/2d`, `/gfx/thebes`
- Thebes: our old way of rendering to the screen
  - old enough that it doesn't map well to modern graphics APIs
  - rewrite in progress (as of 2016)
- Layers for compositing in `/gfx/layers`
  - All the boxes we had get organized into Layers
  - The static parts of the page are grouped together as one layer, paint that into a texture on the graphics card
  - Things that are changing get their own layers, sent off as textures to the graphics card
  - Ship all the layers off to the GPU to be squashed together and composited all at once
- Lots of third-party graphics code managed by the gfx team:
  - `/angle`, `/cairo`, `/graphite2`, `/harfbuzz`, `/ots`, `/skia`, `/ycbcr`

For this introductory talk, we're skipping the final stages of rendering.

What else is in Gecko?

Storage in `/storage`
- We use SQLite for many things
- IndexedDB, localStorage use SQLite
- Browser history (the Places DB)
- Cookies
- ServiceWorker cache API is backed by SQLite
- Not an ORM. We run SQL strings everywhere.
- MozStorage provides a nice multithreaded API over SQLite
  - e.g. run query in background thread, then return results async

Images, `/image`
- We wrote a .bmp decoder
- For newer formats, we use third-party libraries: libpng, libjpeg, libgif
- Decoding images & transforming into suitable form for the gfx code
- Decoding is done off the main thread
- We use a thread pool to parallelize up to the computer's limits

Media in `/media`
- Largely imported code for sound, image, video handling
- Also where (imported) WebRTC implementation lives

Widget code in `/widget`
- Interface between Gecko and OS native event and window handling
- Abstraction layer (generic IDLs)
- Separate directories for various platforms:
  - `/android`, `/cocoa` (mac), `/donk` (B2G, now deleted as of 2021), `/gtk` (linux), `uikit` (iOS), `/windows`

IPC (inter-process communication) code lives in `/ipc`
- Code for managing multiple processes
- Electrolysis (e10s) separates out browsing duties:
  - Parent process (handles user interaction)
  - Child proc: web content code, JS, etc. for responsiveness & security
- This code originally came from Chromium ~5 years ago (i.e. 2011 I guess?)
  - It's now been modified beyond all mergeability. An unintentional fork.
  - If you hit bugs, likely worth looking upstream for existing fixes.
- Big chunks here:
  - sending / receiving messages
  - Object serialization / deserialization
  - A separate event loop (more on this in a bit)
  - IPDL code generator

JavaScript engine in `/js`
- Our JS implementation: parsing, interpretation, JIT compiler, GC, etc.
- To encourage embedding, we have public interfaces in `/js/public`
  - But we don't invest in this right now
- The source code lives in `/js/src`

XPConnect: `/js/xpconnect`
- "Deep Magic": manages reflection of objects between JS and C++
- Also defines our security architecture for JS
  - See Script Security in source docs for details

MFBT `/mfbt`
- "Mozilla Framework Based on Templates" (backronym and quite a stretch)
- Code shared between Gecko and the JS engine
  - Classes we find useful
  - Polyfills for C++ stdlib things
  - The stdlib is inconsistent across platforms, so we have code to smooth it out
  - Close to C++11, aiming to delete large chunks of `/mfbt` someday

XPCOM `/xpcom`
- "Cross-platform COM" (component object model)
- Idea: use code in multiple languages via shared language-agnostic interfaces
  - This was inspired by some Microsoft ideas from the 90s
- We tried to do this across platforms, with varying degrees of success.
- Lots of building blocks in here:
  - Data structures (arrays, hashtables, strings)
  - Core event loop (timers, threads)
    - Main thread and nonmain threads
    - Interacts with IPC event loop in various ways
  - Parts of the JS interface to chrome code (XPConnect uses this stuff)
    - Interacts with XPConnect code, mostly machine-dependent parts
  - Not quite complete abstract IO interface (stream abstraction that provides bytes, etc)
    - Most implementations of the abstract interface live in `/netwerk` for historical reasons
  - Cycle collector: part of the reference counting memory management code
    - Much more on this later in the talk

NSPR `/nspr`
- Netscape Portable Runtime, 20+ years old
- Abstracts threads, locks, I/O, logging, etc.
- We use NSPR when it's convenient
  - Sometimes we have nice wrappers (XPCOM has other nice wrappers for some threading stuff)
  - Sometimes we use things directly (I/O)
  - Sometimes stdlib has better alternatives
- Slowly working on removing NSPR
  - NSPR is a separate repo and team from Gecko
  - Separate release schedule, etc.

## Part 2: Gecko C++

C++ Style Guide

- We have a style guide
- Not all code conforms to the style guide
  - We're working on it
- Please use the style guide for new code
  - Follow local conventions when necessary
  - `/dom`, `/layout` are stricter than `/gfx`
  - Use `clang-format` if you like

C++ Features

- We don't use exceptions
  - Historically, exceptions weren't good on some platforms
  - They've gotten better, but converting Gecko to be exception-safe would be a huge chore
- We don't use RTTI (dynamic_cast, e.g.)
  - Bloat, doesn't work with JS-implemented things
  - We already have an equivalent dynamic cast that's JS compatible
  - RTTI not supported on Android
- We have a page with our C++ feature support matrix across C++ versions and different compilers

Brief note on portability
- Across platforms, rate of new feature adoption differs, quality of implementation differs
- Guarantees provided by interfaces may not be strong enough for us
  - e.g. we need memory reporting, std::vector doesn't support this
- Hence, we reimplement the wheel in some places

C++ std:: classes
- Historically, we avoid std:: things
- We don't use exceptions, std does
- It's not necessarily available everywhere
- Please use Gecko versions if possible
- Please file bugs on Gecko versions if you find an API annoying

Infallible allocation (`new T(...)` or `new T[]`)
- By convention, if out of memory, allocation will crash, rather than returning a null pointer
- We don't return null, so we never need to rely on consistent null-checking
- Useful for debugging things
  - e.g. if you try to allocate 100MB, crash immediately.
  - Otherwise, you get a null pointer back, sometime later you may dereference a null pointer--but it's very hard to see how/where that happened.
  - So, this makes things simpler to debug
  - Also shorter: no need for lots of null checks
- If you need an array but don't control the allocation amount, we do have options
  - Fallible allocation: `new (fallible) T(...)`
  - Similar to `nothrow` in stdlib, predates it

C++ Visibility
- We ship one big shared library, `xul.dll`, `/xul.so`
- Improves startup time
- Exporting symbols from XUL is expensive
  - Runtime penalties, size penalties
  - Exposed interface penalties (malware hooks, etc)
- Strive to export as little as possible
  - Generally the Right Thing happens by default

Threads
- Main (UI) thread
  - Handles all user interaction, most content stuff
  - Important to avoid long blocking operations
  - Particularly important to avoid I/O on the main thread
- Lots of (mostly idle) helper threads
  - SQLite, media/image decoding, network cache, JS JIT compilation, JS GC, timers

## 3. Code Generation

- Used extensively in Gecko
- 3 main kinds of code generation
  1. XPIDL: old bindings between JS and C++
  2. IPDL: multi-process communication
  3. WebIDL: new way of doing bindings between JS and C++
- We have other, one-off code generators throughout the tree
- All written in Python

XPIDL files
- Most useful for understanding how we get from JS to C++
- "Cross-platform IDL"
- Defining interfaces for either C++ or JS to implement
- Generates C++ class boilerplate
- Generates metadata for calling into C++ from JS (argument conversions)
- Docs on MDN (RIP, TODO find them and pull into firefox docs somewhere)

XPIDL: Generated code
- Generates headers for each `.idl` in `$OBJDIR/dist/include`
- `nsIFile.idl` generates `nsIFile.h`
- IDL can define multiple interfaces per file => generated header will have multiple class definitions
- Each interface nsIFoo generates:
  - `nsIFoo` class definition (empty methods)
  - `NS_DECL_IFOO` macro for declaring all of `nsIFoo`'s interface in C++
  - Every interface has a UUID, there are `NS_IFILE_IID` and `NS_IFILE_STR` macros for the UUID
  - other macros, rarely needed

Some IDL -> C++ examples:

IDL: `const unsigned long NORMAL_FILE_TYPE=0;` (note: you don't get strongly-typed enums)
C++: `enum { NORMAL_FILE_TYPE=0 };`

IDL: `void append(in AString node);`
C++: `NS_IMETHOD Append(const nsAString&);`
- Note the IDL parameters need to be annotated with `in` or `out` to indicate if they are passed in or received out

IDL: `bool exists();`
C++: `NS_IMETHOD Exists(bool*);`

IDL: `readonly attribute long long fileSize;`
C++: `NS_IMETHOD GetFileSize(int64_t*);`
- By convention, `readonly` attributes return a getter

IDL: `attribute AString leafName;`
C++: `NS_IMETHOD GetLeafName(nsAString&);` and `NS_IMETHOD SetLeafName(const nsAString&)`
- By convention, modifiable attributes generate getter and setter in C++

- By convention, return values are a pointer.
- `NS_IMETHOD` is short for `virtual nsresult` + windows-specific goo
- `nsresult` is our status code
  - Success case: `NS_OK`
    - Please don't use the other success values
  - Failure: `NS_ERROR_FAILURE` and many others
    - Please return the most specific error available
  - Test the return value with `NS_SUCCEEDED(val)` or `NS_FAILED(val)`, don't check directly
  - Complete list of errors: `/xpcom/base/ErrorList.h`

Methods
- Return values are passed through outparams
- Only set outparam when you're returning `NS_OK`
- Don't use the outparam at caller until you check `NS_SUCCEEDED`
- Always propagate errors to caller(s)
- XPConnect maps errors to JS exceptions automatically

Getters / Setters
- Both can fail
- Same outparam convention as methods

### IPDL

- IPDL files describe multi-process messaging "protocols
  - List of messages sent by parent or child
- Code generator generates the uninteresting, repetitive parts
  - e.g. serialization / deserialization
- Protocols are sorted into a hierarchy
  - e.g. PContent does top-level e10s per tab
  - PContent manages other protocols
  - Similarly, child has its own hierarchy / tree of protocols
- Provides C++ structure for the interesting parts (defines virtual handler methods)
- Lives in `ipc/ipdl/ipdl.py`
  - Not great fun to work with, infrequently modified
  - C++ code goes to `$OBJDIR/ipc/ipdl`
  - C++ headers to `$OBJDIR/ipc/ipdl/_ipdlheaders`
  - Headers organized by C++ namespace

### WebIDL

TODO

## Memory Management

Owned pointers

std::unique_ptr - encapsulates lots of details of passing ownership of pointers around (for exclusive-ownership)
- Not available because not all our platforms support it

But we do have Mozilla::UniquePtr (in mfbt)
- Same interface as `std::unique_ptr`
- Anywhere you might need to pass raw pointers around, use UniquePtr instead

The old way: (gone from Gecko as of 2021, it seems)
- `nsAutoPtr<T>` and `nsAutoArrayPtr<T>`
  - Similar to `std::auto_ptr`
  - Like `auto_ptr`, these are deprecated too

Shared pointers
- We do this by reference counting
- `AddRef()` and `Release()` methods
  - Doesn't matter virtualness or not
  - You just need the names and parameters, if any
- Unlike `std::shared_ptr`, which manages proxies to objects, in Gecko, objects manage their own refcounts directly
- If you just want to pass around shared data, `std::shared_ptr` is easier
- For Gecko, we control all the data, so we just manage refcount directly

Reference counting: thread safety
- Thread safety: thread-safe and non-threadsafe options are supported
- `std::shared_ptr` only available in thread-safe version
- If you're passing objects among threads, please use thread-safe refcounting
- DEBUG builds verify thread usage by:
  - marking the owning thread that allocates the object using nonsafe reference counting
  - all future refcount operations will check if they are on the owning thread, and crash if not
  - else, bad things may happen in non-debug builds

Smart pointers
- Used to avoid needing to manually call `AddRef()` / `Release()`
- `RefPtr<T>`
  - found in `/mfbt`
  - Used for concrete classes
- `nsCOMPtr<T>`
  - Very old, XPCOM smart pointer
  - Used with interface classes: XPIDL, `nsI*`
  - Cooperates with many other things
    - Lots of `do_Thing` helpers

Cycles
- Reference counting is not perfect
- Easy to create cyclic references => memory leaks
- Not just C++ <=> C++ cycles, either.
  - Cycles can include JS objects!
- Avoiding this: we tried avoiding cycles, using raw pointers (scary)

Refcounting: Cycle Collector
- Rather than manually break cycles, periodically detect & collect cycles
  - Integration with JS GC to trigger this
  - JS GC triggers things, then cycle collector looks for cycles
- If an object participates in cycle collection, `AddRef()` / `Release()` do extra work to notify cycle collector
- Generally only for DOM things (not network or gfx)
- Lots of obtuse macros for making this almost-nice

Refcounting: declaration
- Macros handle lots of this
- For `nsISupports` things (anything with XPIDL associated to it):
  - `NS_DECL_ISUPPORTS` single-threaded
  - `NS_DECL_THREADSAFE_ISUPPORTS` thread-safe
  - Drop these macros in your class declaration

Refcounting: definition
- In concrete `nsThing.cpp`, list concrete classname and list of implemented interfaces
  - `NS_IMPL_SUPPORTS(nsThing, nsIThing, ...);`
- Same syntax for thread-safe and non-thread-safe classes
- For non-`nsISupports` things:
  - `NS_INLINE_DECL_REFCOUNTING` single-threaded
  - `NS_INLINE_DECL_THREADSAFE_REFCOUNTING` multi-threaded

Refcounting: implementation
- Generally, the macros provide all you'll need
- See `xpcom/glue/nsISupportsImpl.h` for the grotty details

Leak Checking
- DEBUG only
- We have leak checking tooling for refcounted things
- Not as complete as Valgrind / Asan
- Refcounted classes are automatically leak checked
- Individual `malloc`/`new` isn't counted
  - ASan / Valgrind test runs to check leaks, but totally separate from our debug builds

Leak Checking: macros
- Also possible to leak check non-reference counted classes
- Helpful to ensure new code manages memory correctly
- Include reference to `MOZ_COUNT_CTOR(klassname)` in all constructors
- In destructor, `MOZ_COUNT_DTOR(klassname)`

Limitations:
- Checking hierarchies is difficult
  - We generally avoid hierarchies in Gecko
  - `MOZ_COUNT_CTOR_INHERITED` is available, but rarely used
  - Generally just use `MOZ_COUNT_CTOR` in the base class
- Checking templates classes is difficult
  - Solution: use a non-templated base class
  - Same approach as inherited / hierarchies

More info:
- BloatView, MDN article (RIP TODO find this)
  - Runs on DEBUG tests by default
  - Also has info on leaks not reproducible locally

Refcounting: ownership transfers
- Want to avoid passing raw pointers to refcounted classes
- You have a smart pointer to some class, allocate it, do stuff with it
- How do you get a pointer to that object out of your method?
- Can't just return the raw pointer: the ref will get released, you'll be passing a pointer to freed memory 🙀

Ownership transfer strategies
- As usual with Gecko, there are many ways to do it
- Oldest: outparam `T**`
  - Some class returns a pointer to `T*`, so, class pointer pointer
  - Common with XPIDL-style interfaces
- More common on C++ side: `already_AddRefed<T>` return value
  - Generally indicates new object entirely yours
  - Means: I'm giving you a pointer that has had `AddRef()` called on it
  - Typically used in create interfaces as a return value
  - Means also: need to `Release()` it at some point
  - Can't do much with it except assign it to a smart pointer
- "Modern" way: return `RefPtr<T>` or `nsCOMPtr<T>`
  - Pass around or return smart pointers themselves
  - With recent C++ standard changes, now actually efficient
    - In the past, might or might not be efficient
  - Not currently super safe with our current smart pointer implementation with current compilers
  - Planning to make improvements

Ownership transfers: summary table

|    | Pointer outparam | `already_AddRefed<T>` | Smart pointer |
|----|------------------|-----------------------|---------------|
|Identifying feature|`T**` argument (usually last in args list, in XPIDL) | return type | return type |
|Passing ownership from a smart pointer| `p.forget(outparam);` (stores the wrapped pointer into the outparam) | `return p.forget();` | `return p;` |
|Caller (Starting with `RefPtr <T> p;`| `o->Method(getter_AddRefs(p));` | `p = o->Method();` | `p = o->Method();` |
|Use cases| XPIDL-style interfaces, especially for helper methods called by XPIDL methods | static `Create()` methods| many |

QueryInterface: XPCOM's dynamic_cast

Next couple sections: brief digression into nuts & bolts of XPIDL, XPCOM

- Every class/interface in Gecko gets a UUID
  - tied specifically to the interface
- Given a random pointer, `nsISupports` pointer
- Can check if the pointer supports a given interface by passing it a UUID
- We have infrastructure to simplify these checks

### `do_QueryInterface()`

- Given pointer `nsCOMPtr<nsIFoo> foo`
- If you want to know if it supports `nsIBar`
- Just do `nsCOMPtr<nsIBar> bar = do_QueryInterface(foo);`
- `bar` will be non-null if `foo` was non-null and supports `nsIBar`
- Handles null-checking `foo`, looking up interface UUID for `nsIBar`, looking up list of interface UUIDs supported by `foo`
- Because QI does the null-check for you, you can QI through multiple interfaces and only null-check once at the end.

### `do_CreateInstance()`

- Used for creating objects across C++ and JS (for XPIDL)
- Because we don't use exceptions in C++, the constructor cannot return an error
- So, we construct a minimal object, then call an `init()` method to finish initializing
- To avoid using UUIDs, we have a thing called "contract ID" (typically defined in IDL)
  - Example: "@mozilla.org/foo;1".
  - Stays the same even if the interface changes (hence, the UUID must be updated)
  - Reduces churn due to UUID evolution / interface evolution
- Syntax enforces creation/initialization separation
  - Makes it easy to get `ns_result` from `init()` and relay to JS as a JS Exception
- C++ syntax:
  - construction: `nsCOMPtr<nsIFoo> f = do_CreateInstance("@mozilla.org/foo;1");`
  - initialization: `nsresult rv = f->init();`
- JS syntax:
  - construction: `let f = Cc["@mozilla.org/foo;1"].createInstance(nsIFoo);`
  - initialization: `f.init();`
- On the C++ side, typically better to just directly init via the constructor, instead of doing all this indirection
- On the JS side, this machinery is unavoidable, so these patterns are necessary

### `do_GetService()`

- Services are XPCOM's singletons
- They are lazily created by `do_GetService()`
- Enforced only by convention: if you `do_CreateInstance` instead, strange things may happen
  - Weirdness is especially likely if you `do_CreateInstance` more than once
- `do_GetService` is prohibitively slow for common services
- Instead, we have a faster way to get common services: `services::` (aka Services.jsm on JS side)
  - defined in `xpcom/build/ServiceList.h`
- Syntax examples:
  - `do_GetService`: `nsCOMPtr<nsICatchyService> service = do_GetService("@mozilla.org/catchy;1");`
  - faster `services` global: `nsCOMPtr<nsICatchyService> service = services::GetCatchyService();`

### `do_GetInterface()`

- Was meant to replace attribute access
- `nsIInterfaceRequestor` is a fairly common interface
- Used to ask an object if it has something corresponding to some interface UUID
- Could return anything that conforms to the UUID:
  - might return a direct member of the concrete class
  - or the class itself
  - or something else entirely that happens to implement that interface UUID among many others
- This is not a good pattern
  - e.g. browser code will QI to `nsIInterfaceRequestor`,
  - then get some interface,
  - then query that interface to `nsIInterfaceRequestor`, etc.
- Long, ugly chain of operations to do something relatively simple
- To make matters worse, it's not always clear if you should `do_GetInterface` or `QueryInterface`
- Don't use this in new code.
- Instead, just provide an attribute or method to access a concrete thing, and sidestep the UUID machinery
  - Example: given `nsCOMPtr<nsIFoo> foo`. How to get an `nsIBar` from `foo`?
  1. `nsCOMPtr<nsIInterfaceRequestor> iir = do_QueryInterface(foo);`
  2. `nsComPtr<nsIBar> bar = do_GetInterface(iir);`
  - `bar` is non-null if `foo` was non-null and supported `nsIInterfaceRequestor` and knew how to provide `nsIBar` things
  - null-check `bar` just once at the end and you're done
- Again: you may see this, but don't use it in new code.

A few final bits still need to be copied over from my paper notes:

- Gecko C++ Data Structures
  - XPCOM / MFBT Data Structures: Growable vectors, hashtables, lists, strings, string helpers
- NSPR logging
- Debugging: `./mach run`, rr (time-traveling record replay debugger, linux only)
