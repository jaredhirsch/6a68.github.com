### Instructions for things

- install stuff: `bundle`
  - note: on Mac OS, particularly across version updates, ruby probably won't Just Work. see, e.g., [this post](https://www.moncefbelyamani.com/how-to-install-xcode-homebrew-git-rvm-ruby-on-mac/#start-here-if-you-choose-the-long-and-manual-route) to get ruby working (again)
- serve locally: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
- adding deps? check in `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock`
